# Project-7-Logistic-Linear-Regression
Here I have analysis HSBC Customer Data by Logistic Linear Regression Methodology
● HSBC collects data on its customers, including their income, employment history, credit history, and other demographic information.
● This data can be used to predict which customers are more likely to repay their credit card debt and which customers are more likely to default
● HSBC wants to use its customer data to predict which customers should be approved for credit cards and which customers should be rejected.
● This will help HSBC to make more informed decisions about who to lend money to, and it will help to reduce the risk of default.
